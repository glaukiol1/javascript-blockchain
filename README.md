Blockchain Tech in JavaScript, the base of any Cryptocurrency is implemented, but dont get confused. ***ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE FOR PRODUCTION***!

## Info
This project was made in late 2019, so I can say the code isnt very far off when it comes to todays practices. I recommend adding some of the more advanced features into this, such as,
```
$ sudo cat list_of_recommended_features.txt
 # ---------------------------------------- List
 1: Add dynamic gas price to transactions
 2: Add the fundamentals of the mining concept
 3: Add smart contracts
 # ---------------------------------------- End
$ |
```

Whatever you choose to do with this is up to you. Good Luck!
